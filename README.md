Data Cleaning & Linear Regression for Car Price Prediction
I recently tackled a car data analysis project using Python. Here's a quick rundown:
Data Cleaning: Cleaned up Quikr car data by handling missing values, converting types, and removing outliers.
EDA: Explored data distributions with Matplotlib and Seaborn to understand price variations by company, year, and fuel type.
Feature Engineering: Engineered features like car name, company, year, km driven, and fuel type for modeling.
Linear Regression Modeling: Trained a model using scikit-learn, optimizing it for accuracy.
Deployment: Serialized the model using pickle for future predictions.
